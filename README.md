# Meteor-Angular-Todo-App
Created a To-Do list application using MeteorJS and AngularJS

Learned MeteorJS by creating a full-stack responsive single page to-do list web application.
Meteor serves as a full-stack solution, basically replacing NodeJS and ExpressJS.
AngularJS was used for the front end.
This application uses MongoDB for its databases to store its data.
MochaJS was used for testing.
